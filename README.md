## 🔥 Highlights

- Source from 6M+ pull requests and 23000+ repositories.
- Cover 5200 Repositories.
- 100k high-quality instances.
- 71k trajectories from DeepSeek v3.2 with 3.5B token.
- Strong performance: 64% in SWE-bench-Verified trained from Qwen3-30A3B-Instruct.

## 📣 News
- **2026-02-26** 🚀 We released a portion of our data on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/AweAI-Team/scale-swe). This release includes **20,000 SWE task instances**—currently the largest **Real Executable** open-source SWE dataset available—alongside **71k distillation trajectories(3.5B)** from DeepSeek v3.2. **Much more data** will be released in the future.
- **2026-02-10** 📝 Our paper [**"Immersion in the GitHub Universe: Scaling Coding Agents to Mastery"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09892) is now available on arXiv.

## 📊 Data Format


| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`instance_id`** | A unique identifier formatted as `{user}_{repo}_pr{id}`. |
| **`user`** | The owner of the GitHub repository. |
| **`repo`** | The name of the GitHub repository. |
| **`language`** | The programming language of the codebase (currently Python). |
| **`workdir`** | The working directory path within the environment. |
| **`image_url`** | The URL of the pre-built Docker image for the task. |
| **`patch`** | The ground-truth patch (**Golden Patch**) from the corresponding pull request. |
| **`pr_commit`** | The commit hash of the pull request. |
| **`parent_commit`** | The commit hash of the parent commit (base state). |
| **`problem_statement`** | The issue description conveying the bug, provided to the model as input. |
| **`f2p_patch`** | The developer-written test patch containing tests that fail before the fix (if available). |
| **`f2p_script`** | The synthetic reproduction script generated by our unit-test creator agent. |
| **`FAIL_TO_PASS`** | Unit tests that fail on the buggy version but pass after the fix. |
| **`PASS_TO_PASS`** | Unit tests that pass in both versions (regression tests). |
| **`github_url`** | The URL of the original GitHub repository. |
| **`pre_commands`** | These commands must be executed immediately upon entering the container to check out the correct commit. |

## 🤖 Results
We fine-tuned Qwen-30B-A3B-Instruct on our synthesized trajectories.
